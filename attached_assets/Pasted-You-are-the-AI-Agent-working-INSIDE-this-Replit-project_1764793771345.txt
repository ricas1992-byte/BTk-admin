You are the AI Agent working INSIDE this Replit project.
The Git remote is:
https://github.com/ricas1992-byte/BTk-admin.git

Your tasks:

====================================================
A. DEFINE THREE HEBREW COMMANDS FOR GIT WORKFLOW
====================================================

1) When I write in Hebrew: "שמור לגיט"
you will:

- Use Replit's built-in Git integration (NOT the raw shell) to:
  1. Stage all changed files.
  2. Create a commit with the message: "Update from Replit".
  3. Push the commit to the connected GitHub repository
     (origin/main → https://github.com/ricas1992-byte/BTk-admin.git).

- If there are no changes to commit, respond in Hebrew:
  "לא בוצעו שינויים — אין מה לשמור."

- If there is any Git error or a GUI confirmation is needed,
  explain in very simple Hebrew exactly what I need to click in the Replit Git panel.

2) When I write in Hebrew: "משוך מגיט"
you will:

- Use Replit's Git integration to pull from the remote (origin/main).
- If everything is already up to date, respond in Hebrew:
  "הקוד בריפליט מעודכן מול GitHub."
- If there are incoming changes, pull them and briefly explain in Hebrew what changed.
- If there is any conflict or error, do NOT try anything risky.
  Instead:
  - Describe the problem in simple Hebrew.
  - Tell me exactly what text to copy and paste to my main ChatGPT assistant.

3) When I write in Hebrew: "בדוק גיט"
you will:

- Check the current Git status of this project using Replit's Git tools.
- Then respond in clear Hebrew:
  - האם יש קבצים ששונו שעדיין לא נשמרו (Uncommitted changes)?
  - האם הרימוט הראשי הוא:
    https://github.com/ricas1992-byte/BTk-admin.git ?
  - האם הסניף הפעיל הוא main?
- If there are uncommitted changes, say:
  "יש שינויים שלא נשמרו. כתוב 'שמור לגיט' כדי לשמור אותם."
- If everything is clean and synced, say:
  "הכול שמור ומסונכרן. מצב הגיט תקין."

====================================================
B. CREATE / UPDATE README.md AND SAVE IT TO GITHUB
====================================================

Now create (or overwrite) a file called README.md at the root of the project
with the following content (you may adjust minor details to match the actual stack):

# BTK Admin – Beyond the Keys Management System

BTK Admin is a web-based admin and learning management interface
for the **"Beyond the Keys (BTK)"** project.

It is used to manage Hebrew, RTL-oriented learning content:
courses, modules, and learning materials such as documents, audio, and video.

## Features

- Course management (create, edit, delete)
- Module management per course
- Uploading and organizing learning files (DOCX, PDF, audio, video)
- Hebrew Right-to-Left (RTL) user interface for learners and admins
- Simple dashboard for viewing and controlling BTK learning content

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: (detect and list the actual framework here, e.g. React + Vite or plain HTML/JS)
- Backend: (detect and list, e.g. Node.js + Express)
- Storage / Database: (describe briefly what this Repl is using)

## Getting Started (in Replit)

1. Open this project in Replit.
2. Click the **Run** button.
3. Open the Webview URL that Replit shows to access the app.

## Development Workflow

- Make changes in Replit.
- To save your work to GitHub, type in the Agent chat:
  **"שמור לגיט"**
- To sync from GitHub into Replit, type:
  **"משוך מגיט"**
- To check Git status, type:
  **"בדוק גיט"**

---

After creating README.md:

1. Ensure the file is saved.
2. Automatically perform the "שמור לגיט" behavior:
   - Stage, commit with a clear message (for example: "Add README"),
     and push to GitHub using Replit's Git integration.

Finally, confirm in Hebrew that:
- README.md was created/updated,
- and that the latest version was pushed to GitHub.

Acknowledge these instructions now.
